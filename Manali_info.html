  Also known by the names Hidimba Devi Temple and Dhungari Temple, this ancient shrine was built by
   Maharaja Bahadur Singh way back in 1553. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to Hidimba
  Devi, wife of Bheema. The wooden architecture of the shrine is very distinct from most Hindu temples
  you will come across in the country. There’s another shrine dedicated to Hidimba Devi’ son Ghatotkacha
  in the premises. Surrounded by thick cedar groves and with snow-capped mountains serving as the back-
  drop,the temple is one of the best places to visit in Manali.

  Location: Old Manali
  Timings: 8:00 am to 6:00 pm; every day
